# confusion-matrix
This project in Urmia University was defined by Dr. Taj Bakhsh for the students. The goal of this project is to analyze a prepared data based on the confusion matrix table. This table has many parameters based on 4 methods

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- kNearest Neighbor
- SVM
  
We learned and analyzed the data using the 5-fold cross validation method. We also drew ROC charts for these 4 methods and compared the training speed of these 4 methods.
